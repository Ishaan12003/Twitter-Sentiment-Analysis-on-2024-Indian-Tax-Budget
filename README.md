# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-on-2024-Indian-Tax-Budget

This project will analyze public sentiment toward the 2024 Indian Tax Budget by web scraping
data on X (formerly Twitter). Further, we introduce the state-of-the-art deep learning models,
namely BERT and Vader. They enhance our analysis with more subtle linguistic patterns. BERT
is with transformer architecture, thus allowing contextual sentiment classification, whereas
Vader is optimized for the short-form, informal wording that characterizes postings on social
media.
